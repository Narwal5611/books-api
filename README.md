This is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express to manage a list of books. It supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Data is stored in memory (not in a database).
- `GET /books` → List all books
- `POST /books` → Add a new book
- `PUT /books/:id` → Update a book by ID
- `DELETE /books/:id` → Delete a book by ID

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman (for API testing)
